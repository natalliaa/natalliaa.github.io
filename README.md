Hi! I am a junior web developer looking for a new role. My expertise is in designing and developing user-friendly web applications using modern technologies: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, React, JavaScript, ES6, and Node.js. Next to my technical competencies, I have great communication skills from my former career as a world language teacher. My other passions include ultramarathons, hiking, and traveling. Have a look at some of my projects and get in touch with me. I am located near Boulder in Colorado and open to work remotely.
